            Summary
          </h3>

           <p>
            Unemployment has decreased over the past three years for most groups, with the exception of Indian and other Asian people, who have seen a small increase in unemployment. Younger people across all backgrounds have a significantly higher rate of unemployment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2015, ethnic minorities have higher rates of unemployment, with people from a black background having the highest unemployment rate at 14%.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whilst unemployment for both men and women is just above 5% in the UK, black men are more likely to be unemployed than black women, and Pakistani or Bangladeshi women are far more likely to be unemployed than Pakistani or Bangladeshi men.

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> How this is measured</h3>
          <p>
            The level and rate of UK unemployment measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation. Unemployed people as those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Things you need to know </h3>

          <p>
            Unemployment figures are survey based. Smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic
            minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more
            volatile than estimates for white people.

           We are using the categories from the <a href ="#">Labour Force Survey</a> which are: White, Black, Mixed or multiple, Indian, Pakistani/Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other Asian, Other, Unknown.

          <p>
            Chinese moved from Other ethnic group to the Asian category in 2011, therefore Chinese has been included under Asian for the years preceding 2011; New tick boxes were also introduced for Gypsy or Irish Traveller under White and Arab under Other ethnic group

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Gender </h3>

          <p>
          The overall unemployment rate for males in the UK is slightly higher than that for females
          </p>

          <p>
            In the year to June 2016, the male unemployment rate was 5.2% compared to a female
            unemployment rate of 5.0%. However, this hides some differences across ethnic groups.
            Among people from a white, Black and “other ethnic” background, the unemployment
            rate was similar or slighter higher for men than for women.
          </p>

          <p>
            Women from a Bangladeshi/ Pakistani background had the highest unemployment rate of
            16%, which was double that of Bangladeshi/ Pakistani men.
          </p>

          <p>
            The reasons for economic inactivity can vary considerably between ethnic groups and between men and women. A number of factors contribute that can be both socio economic and cultural. They may also be influenced by the age distribution of the population which varies across ethnic groups.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main reason for men being economically inactive in the 2011 Census was because they were a student (37%) or sick and disabled (27%), whereas the main reason for women was because they were looking after the family and home (31%).
          </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Age trends</h3>

          <p>The unemployment rate for young black people aged 16-24 was the highest at 30% in
            the year to June 2016. This compared to youth unemployment rates of 13% for white
            people (the lowest) and 26% for people from a Bangladeshi/ Pakistani ethnic background
            (the second highest).</p>

          <p>White people had the lowest unemployment rate in all age categories.
          For all ethnic groups shown in the table the unemployment rate was higher among 16-24
          year olds than for other age groups. </p>

            Methodology
          </h3>

          <p>The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over,
          covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all
          drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported
          by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally
          adjusted.</p>

          <p>Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by
          statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub
          groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based
          on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-
          10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with
          particular caution. </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">
            Type of data
          </h3>

          Survey

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Sample size</h3>

          <p>The LFS is a UK household sample survey which collects information from
          approximately 45,000 households each quarter. Since those responses reflect only a
          sample (around 1 in 650) of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the
          basis of subnational population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire
          UK household population.</p>

          <p>New population estimates based on the 2011 Census of Population were used by the
          Office for National Statistics to produce updated LFS data and labour market
          statistics. These re-weighted figures were available from October 2014 and were
          published in the Labour Market Status by Ethnic Group series in December 2014.
          More information on re-weighting can be found at the following link:</p>
          <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/revisions-to-labour-force-survey-estimates-due-tore-weighting-to-the-census-2011-population/article/index.html">http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/revisions-to-labour-force-survey-estimates-due-tore-weighting-to-the-census-2011-population/article/index.html</a>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Disclosure control</h3>

          <p>We preserve confidentiality. The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Suppression rules</h3>

          <p> We suppress some figures. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on confidentiality.  </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Estimation </h3>

          <p> We round numbers. Percentages are given to 1 decimal place but all gaps and differences have been calculated on unrounded data. Therefore some figures may not match those produced from the rounded figures shown in the tables. All numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000 and may not sum due to rounding. Estimates based on survey responses so subject to sampling error. </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Definitions </h3>

          <p>
          Employed: These are people who are in paid work (as an employee or selfemployed);
          those who have a job that they are temporarily away from; some
          participants on government-supported training and employment programmes; and
          those doing unpaid family work. Employed people are classed as economically
          active.</p>

          <p>ILO unemployed: These are people who are jobless, have been actively seeking
          work in the past four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks; or
          are out of work, but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks.
          This definition of unemployment is the one laid down by the International Labour
          Organisation and is used in regular published UK statistics. Unemployed people are
          classed as economically active.</p>
          <p>
          Economically inactive: These are people without a job who have not actively
          sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start working in the next
          two weeks. Someone in full-time education will normally be classified as
          economically inactive if they are not in paid work, but if they are looking for and are
          available for work then they will be classified as unemployed and hence economically
          active.</p>

          <p>Full-time education (FTE): FTE is defined as those who are either (1) at school (fulltime),
          (2) on a sandwich course or (3) in full time university or college education.</p>
