      Summary

    <p>
      Unemployment has decreased over the past three years for most groups, with the exception of Indian and other Asian people, who have seen a small increase in unemployment. Younger people across all backgrounds have a significantly higher rate of unemployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2015, ethnic minorities have higher rates of unemployment, with people from a black background having the highest unemployment rate at 14%.

    Summary
  </h3>
  <p>
    The overall unemployment rate for males in the UK is slightly higher than that for females.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year to June 2016, the male unemployment rate was 5.2% compared to a female unemployment rate of 5.0%. However, this hides some differences across ethnic groups. Among people from a white, Black and other ethnic background, the unemployment rate was similar or slighter higher for men than for women.
  </p>
  <p>
    Women from a Bangladeshi and Pakistani background had the highest unemployment rate of 16%, which was double that of Bangladeshi and Pakistani men.

    Measure explanation
  </h2>

  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    What ‘unemployment’ is
  </h3>
  <p>
    The rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the potential labour force.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unemployed people are those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks. Find out more about how unemployment is measured.
  </p>
  <p>
    The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation.
  </p>

  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Ethnicity categories used in this analysis
  </h3>
  <p class='margin-bottom-none'>
    We are using the categories from the Labour Force Survey which are:
  </p>
  <ul class='margin-bottom-medium'>
    <li>White</li>
    <li>Black</li>
    <li>Mixed or multiple</li>
    <li>Indian</li>
    <li>Pakistani</li>
    <li>Chinese</li>
    <li>Other Asian</li>
    <li>Other</li>
    <li>Unknown</li>
  </ul>
  <p class='margin-bottom-none'>
    Other ethnic background includes those who responded:
  </p>
  <ul class='margin-bottom-medium'>
    <li>Chinese, other</li>
    <li>Other Asian background</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ‘Chinese’ moved from ‘Other’ ethnic group to the ‘Asian’ category in 2011, therefore ‘Chinese’ has been included under ‘Asian’ for the years preceding 2011.
  </p>
  <p>
    New tick boxes were also introduced for ‘Gypsy or Irish Traveller’ under ‘White’ and ‘Arab’ under ’Other’ ethnic group.

    How the data is measured
  </h2>
  <p>
    Unemployment figures are survey based. Smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more volatile than estimates for white people.
  </p>

  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Methodology
  </h3>
  <p>
    The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over, covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally adjusted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5- 10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.

    Sample size
  </h3>
  <p>
    The LFS is a UK household sample survey which collects information from approximately 45,000 households each quarter. Since those responses reflect only a sample (around 1 in 650) of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the basis of subnational population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire UK household population.
  </p>

  <p>
    New population estimates based on the 2011 Census of Population were used by the Office for National Statistics to produce updated LFS data and labour market statistics. These re-weighted figures were available from October 2014 and were published in the Labour Market Status by Ethnic Group series in December 2014. More information on re-weighting can be found at the following link:

    Disclosure control
  </h3>
  <p>
    We preserve confidentiality. The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.
  </p>

  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Suppression rules
  </h3>
  <p>
    We suppress some figures. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on confidentiality.

    Estimation
  </h3>
  <p>
    We round numbers. Percentages are given to 1 decimal place but all gaps and differences have been calculated on unrounded data. Therefore some figures may not match those produced from the rounded figures shown in the tables. All numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000 and may not sum due to rounding. Estimates based on survey responses so subject to sampling error.

    Definitions
  </h2>
  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Employed
  </h3>
  <p>
    These are people who are in paid work (as an employee or selfemployed), those who have a job that they are temporarily away from, some participants on government-supported training and employment programmes and those doing unpaid family work. Employed people are classed as economically active.
  </p>
  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    ILO unemployed
  </h3>
  <p>
    These are people who are jobless, have been actively seeking work in the past four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks; or are out of work, but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks. This definition of unemployment is the one laid down by the International Labour Organisation and is used in regular published UK statistics. Unemployed people are classed as economically active.
  </p>
  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Economically inactive
  </h3>
  <p>
    These are people without a job who have not actively sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start working in the next two weeks. Someone in full-time education will normally be classified as economically inactive if they are not in paid work, but if they are looking for and are available for work then they will be classified as unemployed and hence economically active.
  </p>
  <h3 class='heading-small'>
    Full-time education (FTE)
  </h3>
  <p>
    FTE is defined as those who are either (1) at school (fulltime), (2) on a sandwich course or (3) in full time university or college education.
