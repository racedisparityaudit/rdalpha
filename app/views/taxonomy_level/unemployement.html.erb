      What ‘unemployment’ is
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the potential labour force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unemployed people are those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks. Find out more about how unemployment is measured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation.

          Changes were made to the Labour Force Survey ethnicity questions in January to March 2011 to bring them more in line with Census data collection on these topics. In April to June 2011 furthers changes were made to the ethnicity questions to bring them in line with Scottish Census. As a result there may be some inconsistencies with estimates prior to 2011.

      Between October and December 2016, Bangladeshi people aged 16+ had the highest unemployment rate (14.3%) - around 30,000 people.

      The rate of unemploymemnt for Bangladeshi people was over 3 times higher than the average for all ethnic groups.

      Chinese people had the lowest unemployment rate. Between October and December 2016, around 6,000 Chinese people (3.5%), aged 16+, were unemployed.

      The rate of unemployment for Chinese people was 2.3 times lower than the average for all ethnic minority groups.

    <p>
      Around 1.2 million (4.1%) of White people aged 16+ were unemployed. The rate of unemploymemnt for White people is nearly 2 times lower than rate for all ethnic minority groups.

          These unemployment figures are estimates based on a national survey and therefore are subject to sampling error and in some cases may not reflect the actual population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smaller numbers of survey respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more unreliable than estimates for White people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnic group, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Estimates for unemployement rates by ethnicity by age by gender are given as annual estimates rather than quarterly estimates as sample sizes are not large enough to give reliable quarterly estimates.

      Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
      The overall unemployment rate for males in the UK is slightly higher than that for females.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the year to June 2016, the male unemployment rate was 5.2% compared to a female unemployment rate of 5.0%. However, this hides some differences across ethnic groups. Among people from a white, Black and other ethnic background, the unemployment rate was similar or slighter higher for men than for women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women from a Bangladeshi and Pakistani background had the highest unemployment rate of 16%, which was double that of Bangladeshi and Pakistani men.

            How the data is measured
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unemployment figures are survey based. Smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more volatile than estimates for white people.
          </p>

          <h3 class='heading-small'>
            Methodology
          </h3>
          <p>
            The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over, covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally adjusted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5- 10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with particular caution.
          </p>

          <h3 class='heading-small'>
            Sample size
          </h3>
          <p>
            The LFS is a UK household sample survey which collects information from approximately 45,000 households each quarter. Since those responses reflect only a sample (around 1 in 650) of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the basis of subnational population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire UK household population.
          </p>

          <p>
            New population estimates based on the 2011 Census of Population were used by the Office for National Statistics to produce updated LFS data and labour market statistics. These re-weighted figures were available from October 2014 and were published in the Labour Market Status by Ethnic Group series in December 2014. More information on re-weighting can be found at the following link:

            Disclosure control
          </h3>
          <p>
            We preserve confidentiality. The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.

            Suppression rules
          </h3>
          <p>
            We suppress some figures. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on confidentiality.

            Estimation
          </h3>
          <p>
            We round numbers. Percentages are given to 1 decimal place but all gaps and differences have been calculated on unrounded data. Therefore some figures may not match those produced from the rounded figures shown in the tables. All numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000 and may not sum due to rounding. Estimates based on survey responses so subject to sampling error.

            Employed
          </h3>
          <p>
            These are people who are in paid work (as an employee or selfemployed), those who have a job that they are temporarily away from, some participants on government-supported training and employment programmes and those doing unpaid family work. Employed people are classed as economically active.
          </p>
          <h3 class='heading-small'>
            ILO unemployed
          </h3>
          <p>
            These are people who are jobless, have been actively seeking work in the past four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks; or are out of work, but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks. This definition of unemployment is the one laid down by the International Labour Organisation and is used in regular published UK statistics. Unemployed people are classed as economically active.
          </p>
          <h3 class='heading-small'>
            Economically inactive
          </h3>
          <p>
            These are people without a job who have not actively sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start working in the next two weeks. Someone in full-time education will normally be classified as economically inactive if they are not in paid work, but if they are looking for and are available for work then they will be classified as unemployed and hence economically active.

            Full-time education (FTE)
          </h3>
          <p>
            FTE is defined as those who are either (1) at school (fulltime), (2) on a sandwich course or (3) in full time university or college education.
