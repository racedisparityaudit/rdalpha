          <h3 class="heading-medium"> How this is measured</h3>
          <p>
            Attainment 8 measures the achievement of a pupil across 8 qualifications including mathematics (double weighted) and English (double weighted), 3 further qualifications that count in the English Baccalaureate (EBacc) measure and 3 further qualifications that can be GCSE qualifications (including EBacc subjects) or any other non-GCSE qualifications on the DfE approved list. Each individual grade a pupil achieves is assigned a point score, which is then used to calculate a pupilâ€™s Attainment 8 score

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Things you need to know </h3>

          <p>
            In 2016 a new secondary school accountability system was implemented. It includes two new headline measures: Attainment 8 and Progress 8. Schools had the option to adopt the new performance measures a year early in 2015. A list of schools that opted in early to the Progress 8 measure can be found here. From 2016, the headline indicator of school performance determining the floor standard is Progress 8. This replaces the previous headline measure, 5+ A* to C including English and maths.

            Methodology
          </h3>

          <p>The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over,
          covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all
          drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported
          by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally
          adjusted.</p>

          <p>Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by
          statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub
          groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based
          on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-
          10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with
          particular caution. </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Population</h3>

          <p>The statistics in this release cover the data collated for the 2016 secondary school performance tables. The performance tables and this release report results based on pupils at the end of key stage 4, who are typically aged 15 at the start of the academic year. The coverage of the local authority (LA) and regional statistics is statefunded schools only in England. This includes city technology colleges and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Disclosure control</h3>

          <p>We preserve confidentiality. The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Suppression rules</h3>

          <p> Values of 1 or 2, or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved; or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular level are suppressed in circumstances where non-suppression would lead to disclosure of pupils. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed.</p>
          <p>
          This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on
          confidentiality.  </p>

          <h3 class="heading-medium"> Estimation </h3>

          <p> We round figures Percentages in this SFR are given to one decimal place. </p>
