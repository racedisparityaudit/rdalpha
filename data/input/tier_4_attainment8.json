  "context":[
    "The GCSE and equivalent results continue to vary between different ethnic groups. Within each of these broader ethnic groupings, the minor ethnic groups show further variability. Chinese pupils are the highest achieving group. Pupils from a black background are the lowest performing group although black pupils are progressing above the national average. Pupils from an Asian background are performing above the national average. Pupils from a mixed background are also performing above the national level. Within the minor ethnic groupings, Indian pupils are performing well above the national average and Gypsy/Roma pupils are the lowest performers."
