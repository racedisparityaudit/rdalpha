OVERVIEW,,-
Measure explanation ,denominator and numerator,"The rate of UK unemployment as a percentage of the potential labour force

Unemployed people are those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks. Find out more about how unemployment is measured.

The level and rate of UK unemployment are measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation."
Summary,"This is where you communicate the most important information about the measure. Points should be ranked in order of importance from a statistical point of view. Each point should be a single bullet point and contain 1 message that is expanded upon further in the more detailed breakdowns below.
We advise a maximum of 5 or 6 main points; if you are getting close to 10 think about whether they are really needed.

Each bullet point should be a single sentence starting with what’s happened, followed by the significance of this.","- In the 2011 Census, the Other White ethnic group (77%) had the highest employment rate of all ethnic groups (aged 16 to 64). This was the case for both men (82%) and women (72%) from this group.
- The proportion of men aged 16 to 64 who were unemployed was highest in the Other Black (17%), White and Black Caribbean (16%) and Caribbean (15%) ethnic groups. For women it was highest for Black African (12%), White and Black Caribbean (11%) and Other Black (11%) groups.
- The highest rates of economic inactivity for men were in the Chinese (40%), Arab (40%) and Gypsy or Irish Travellers (39%) ethnic groups. The highest rates for women were Arab (64%) Bangladeshi (61%), Pakistani (60%) and Gypsy or Irish Traveller (60%).
- Of those in employment, men from the Pakistani (57%), Black African (54%) and Bangladeshi (53%) ethnic groups were most likely to work in low skilled jobs. For women the most likely were Gypsy or Irish Traveller (71%), Bangladeshi (67%) and White and Black Caribbean (66%).
- Of those in employment, Gypsy and Irish Traveller men (41%) and women (18%) had the highest proportion of all ethnic groups who were self-employed.
- Over half (54%) of Bangladeshi men in employment worked part-time (less than 30 hours a week) and just over 1 in 10 worked 15 hours a week or less (12%).
- Bangladeshi (56%) and Gypsy or Irish Traveller (54%) women were the most likely to work part-time (less than 30 hours a week). Bangladeshi and Pakistani women had the highest proportion working less than 15 hours a week (23% and 20% respectively).
- Young people (aged 16-24) from the Gypsy or Irish Travellers (14%), White and Black Caribbean (13%) and Black Caribbean (12%) ethnic groups had the highest proportion of young people who were unemployed."

BACKGROUND,,-
How this is measured,,The level and rate of UK unemployment measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation. Unemployed people as those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks.
Benchmarks,Comparators,
Things you need to know,Caveats e.g. missing data,"Unemployment figures are survey based. Smaller numbers of respondents from ethnic
minority backgrounds mean that unemployment estimates for ethnic minorities are more
volatile than estimates for white people. "
ETHNICITY DEFINITIONS,,-
Ethnicty categories used in this analysis,,"We are using the categories from the Labour Force Survey [link] which are: White, Black, Mixed or multiple, Indian, Pakistani/Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other Asian, Other, Unknown. Other ethnic background includes those who responded Chinese, other, other Asian background and mixed/multiple ethnic groups. Ethnic minority includes [......]"
Further information,EG ,"Chinese moved from Other ethnic group to the Asian category in 2011, therefore Chinese has been included under Asian for the years preceding 2011; New tick boxes were also introduced for Gypsy or Irish Traveller under White and Arab under Other ethnic group"

Breakdown 1 analysis,Consider comparator for this breakdown,"The unemployment rate for young black people aged 16-24 was the highest at 30% in
the year to June 2016. This compared to youth unemployment rates of 13% for white
people (the lowest) and 26% for people from a Bangladeshi/ Pakistani ethnic background
(the second highest).
White people had the lowest unemployment rate in all age categories.
For all ethnic groups shown in the table the unemployment rate was higher among 16-24
year olds than for other age groups. "

Breakdown 2 name,,Gender
Breakdown 2 definitions,,Male / Female
Breakdown 2 analysis,,"The overall unemployment rate for males in the UK is slightly higher than that for females:
in the year to June 2016, the male unemployment rate was 5.2% compared to a female
unemployment rate of 5.0%. However, this hides some differences across ethnic groups.
Among people from a white, Black and “other ethnic” background, the unemployment
rate was similar or slighter higher for men than for women.

Women from a Bangladeshi/ Pakistani background had the highest unemployment rate of
16%, which was double that of Bangladeshi/ Pakistani men. 

The reasons for economic inactivity can vary considerably between ethnic groups and between men and women. A number of factors contribute that can be both socio economic and cultural. They may also be influenced by the age distribution of the population which varies across ethnic groups.

The main reason for men being economically inactive in the 2011 Census was because they were a student (37%) or sick and disabled (27%), whereas the main reason for women was because they were looking after the family and home (31%)."

TECHNICAL INFORMATION,,-
Methodology,,"The data shows figures for the labour market status of people aged 16 and over,
covering annual averages between 1993 and 2015 (excluding 2001). The data is all
drawn from the Labour Force Survey and broken down by ethnic group, as reported
by survey respondents. All data is for Great Britain and has not been seasonally
adjusted.
Results derived from a low number of responses are more likely to be affected by
statistical variation, so observed changes might not reflect real differences. As such, caution is needed when interpreting short-term trends in the data especially for sub
groups (for example, a particular ethnicity, age group and gender). Any values based
on fewer than five responses have been completely suppressed. Values based on 5-
10 responses are shown, but marked by an asterisk (*). These should be used with
particular caution. "
Type of data,"E.G. survey, admin data, management information - and an explanation",Survey
Sample size,,"The LFS is a UK household sample survey which collects information from
approximately 45,000 households each quarter. Since those responses reflect only a
sample (around 1 in 650) of the total population, they are weighted (scaled-up) on the
basis of subnational population totals by age and sex to give estimates for the entire
UK household population.
New population estimates based on the 2011 Census of Population were used by the
Office for National Statistics to produce updated LFS data and labour market
statistics. These re-weighted figures were available from October 2014 and were
published in the Labour Market Status by Ethnic Group series in December 2014.

Disclosure control,,We preserve confidentiality. The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires us to take reasonable steps to ensure that our published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.
Suppression rules,,We suppress some figures. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with our Statistical policy statement on confidentiality.  
Estimation,,"We round numbers. Percentages are given to 1 decimal place but all gaps and differences have been calculated on unrounded data. Therefore some figures may not match those produced from the rounded figures shown in the tables. All numbers are rounded to nearest 10,000 and may not sum due to rounding.

Definitions,,"Definitions:
Employed: These are people who are in paid work (as an employee or selfemployed);
those who have a job that they are temporarily away from; some
participants on government-supported training and employment programmes; and
those doing unpaid family work. Employed people are classed as economically
active.
ILO unemployed: These are people who are jobless, have been actively seeking
work in the past four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks; or
are out of work, but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next two weeks.
This definition of unemployment is the one laid down by the International Labour
Organisation and is used in regular published UK statistics. Unemployed people are
classed as economically active.
Economically inactive: These are people without a job who have not actively
sought work in the last four weeks and/or are not available to start working in the next
two weeks. Someone in full-time education will normally be classified as
economically inactive if they are not in paid work, but if they are looking for and are
available for work then they will be classified as unemployed and hence economically
active.
Full-time education (FTE): FTE is defined as those who are either (1) at school (fulltime),
(2) on a sandwich course or (3) in full time university or college education."
