## Infrastructure

In this section we can add quick notes about infrastructure as we go. The aim is to capture all the details and then clean up / restructure later.

By capturing it in here rather than in other mediums we reduce risk of this info being lost going forward. Also by documenting as we go we make sure something is captured vs trying to remember steps later.
